                <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I'm delighted to see you here. I am a recent graduate
                    from Australian Catholic University and currently working as a QA Analyst in one of the
                    Software companies. Although I work as a QA, I have a deep interest in learning and developing
                    websites. This is one of the first projects that I developed when I started learning the
                    basics. </p>
